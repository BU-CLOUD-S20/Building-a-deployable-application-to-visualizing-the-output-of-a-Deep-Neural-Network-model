## HTML Demo

These files provide an HTML web page that allows users to visualize the output of a deployed computer vision DNN model. Users can improve on and gain insights from their deployed model by uploading query/test images and examining the model results for correctness through the user interface. The interface includes sample query/test images for testing your own model and example output for 3 types of models: image classification, object detection, and image similarity.
